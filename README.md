# A STARWARS 

### Short Description
Star Wars is an American epic space opera media franchise created by
George Lucas, which began with the eponymous 1977 film and quickly
became a worldwide pop-culture phenomenon.
In this exercise, youâ€™ll make a small React application that lists the names of
Star Wars movies in a dropdown and the opening crawl of the selected movie
below the selection along with a list of the characters that appear in that
movie.

### Features of the app
* The user interface has a basic theme of black and yellow.
* Movie names in the dropdown is sorted by release date from earliest to newest.
* No movie selected initially and the app shows the Star Wars logo instead of movie information.
